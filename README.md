## Cart Extra

Cart Extra makes it possible for you to have guest checkout in your ERPNext shopping cart.

### How To Use It?

Install it. That's all.

There are no style changes, or any settings. You get pretty much the same default ERPNext shopping cart experience except that
guests do not need to create an account in order to an account before adding items to their carts.
